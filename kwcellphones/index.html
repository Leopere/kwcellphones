<!--
=======================================================================
IMPORTANT: THIS SITE USES HTML PARTIALS FOR STANDARDIZATION
=======================================================================
- ALWAYS use the JavaScript partial loading system:
  <div id="header-partial"></div>
  <div id="footer-partial"></div>
  <script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      loadPartial('partials/header.html', 'header-partial');
      loadPartial('partials/footer.html', 'footer-partial');
    });
  </script>
- NEVER disable or remove the partials inclusion in pages
- NEVER add navigation code directly to individual pages
- Partials ensure consistent navigation and footer across the site
- Any navigation/footer changes should ONLY be made in the partials
- You CAN and SHOULD modify the partials when updates are needed
